Capstone Project 2020: University Registrar

Description:
Create an app for a University registrar to keep track of students and courses

Use Case:
Main users: admins 
Purpose of the project: Make it easier for students to select courses based on their major requirements.

Minimum Viable Product:
- Capability to add, update, and remove courses (Full CRUD)
- Capability to add name and date enrolled


Tools for MVP: 
(List the tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules, resources, languages, etc that will be used to create your MVP. Be specific.)
C#/ React, Firebase (for hosting and authentication)
EntityFrameworkCore, many-to-many relationship, MySQLWorkBench databases using migrations
MySQL backend 

Additional Features
(If you finish developing your MVP and have time to spare, what features do you want to work on next? Be specific.)
- Capability to detect any schedule conflicts
- User Registration
- User login/sign-out
- Focused on the UI to make it easy friendly for the User
- Create departments. A student can be assigned to a department when they declare their major and a course can be assigned to a department when it is created.
- List out all of the courses or all of the students in a particular department, so that I can inform the counselors which departments need more students and which need more courses.
- Change a student's file to show that they have completed a course, so that I can see if they need to take the course again.
- List out all of the courses a student has taken, so that I can see if they have met their degree requirements.
- Check how many students have not completed courses in any particular departments, so that I can tell the administration which departments need help.
