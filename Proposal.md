* Create concentrations. A student can be assigned to a department when they declare their major and a course can be assigned to a department when it is created.
* List out all of the courses or all of the students in a particular concentration, so that I can inform the counselors which departments need more students and which need more courses.
* Change a student's file to show that they have completed a course, so that I can see if they need to take the course again.
* List out all of the courses a student has taken, so that I can see if they have met their degree requirements.
* Check how many students have not completed courses in any particular departments, so that I can tell the administration which departments need help.
