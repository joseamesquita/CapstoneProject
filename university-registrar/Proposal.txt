Capstone Project 2020: University Registrar

Description:
Create an app for a University registrar to keep track of students and courses

Use Case:
Main users: admins 
Purpose of the project: Make it easier for students to select courses based on their major requirements.

Minimum Viable Product:
- User Registration
- User login/sign-out
- Capability to add, update, and remove courses
- Capability to add and remove courses as students
- Capability to add name and date enrolled
- Capability to detect any schedule conflicts


Tools for MVP: 
(List the tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules, resources, languages, etc that will be used to create your MVP. Be specific.)
C# / React, Firebase (undecided between react and c#)
EntityFrameworkCore, many-to-many relationship, MySQLWorkBench databases using migrations

Additional Features
(If you finish developing your MVP and have time to spare, what features do you want to work on next? Be specific.)
- Focused on the UI to make it easy friendly for the User
- Create departments. A student can be assigned to a department when they declare their major and a course can be assigned to a department when it is created.
- List out all of the courses or all of the students in a particular department, so that I can inform the counselors which departments need more students and which need more courses.
- Change a student's file to show that they have completed a course, so that I can see if they need to take the course again.
- List out all of the courses a student has taken, so that I can see if they have met their degree requirements.
- Check how many students have not completed courses in any particular departments, so that I can tell the administration which departments need help.
